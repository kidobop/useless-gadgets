# Useless Gadgets üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Useless Guys


### Team Members

### Project Description
The Swiss Army Knife of most unnecessary questions. It combines AI-powered image recognition with a groundbreaking digestion calculator to solve problems you never knew you had.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly plagued by questions like "Is this green thing I'm looking at actually a plant?" and "When exactly will my 3 PM Noodles complete its digestive journey?" We've bravely stepped up to solve these non-existent problems.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created a suite of four utterly unnecessary but entertaining tools:
1. üåø Plant Detector: For when you're really not sure if that green thing is a plant
2. üçï Food Identifier: Because sometimes you need AI to tell you what you're eating
3. üê∏ Life Checker: Confirms if something is alive (spoiler: if it's moving, it probably is)
4. ‚è∞ Digestion Calculator: Finally answers the age-old question, "When will my lunch leave my system?"
